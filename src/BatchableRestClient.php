     * must only be included here if we can apply a 'larger/smaller than'
     * filter to them, or they are ordered like this by default.
     *
     * In order to be able to implement some 'batched data set' functionality
     * we have to assume a fixed ordering for our query results - and it seems
     * safe to do so even in some places where Copernica may not officially
     * document this.
     *
     * Below arrays have two to four subvalues:
     * - The name of the property which results are ordered by, by default
     *   (or "always", if the specific API query doesn't support 'orderby').
     * - True if the property value is always unique per entity.
     * - Optional: 'asc' or 'desc' to signify how the results are ordered by
     *   default. Default is 'asc'.
     * - Optional: the query parameter that needs to be given a value, in order
     *   to do filtering, if it's not the general "fields" parameter.
     *
     * The keys are substrings of a resource. We'd be in trouble if multiple
     * resources matching the same string have differing properties, but we'll
     * cross that bridge when we get there. (Some resource matching should stay
     * 'open ended' though, because Copernica allows adding 'useless' parts at
     * the end of some resources.)

     *   are fetching data, it will be missed. The ordering must be ascending.)

     *     will assume non-uniqueness. This does no harm, but changes one
     *     slight detail: the returned set of entities will be 1 less than the
     *     query limit (because the API query will return a batch of entities
     *     including the last already-fetched entity, which will be removed
     *     from the return value). If the caller uses this property to assert
     *     that the field is unique, the call will actually return <limit>
     *     entities (at the danger of missing entities if this assertion is
     *     wrong).
     *   - fall_back_to_unordered (boolean):
     *     If true and if the previous fetch returned entities which all had
     *     the same 'ordered' value, this will fall back to getMoreEntities(),
